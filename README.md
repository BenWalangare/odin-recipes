# odin-recipes

This project, I addded 3 local Indonesian recipes.
First is brenebon, second is panada, and the last is capcay.

To create this simple web, I utilized these previous lessons from TOP:

- how to work with command line basics like:
    - mkdir, rm -r dir, cd dir, cd .., cd, touch example.html, mv file.txt /exampledir/file.txt, l, ls, ls -l
- how to work with git basics:
    - git clone (copy paste the ssh here), git status, git log, git add ., git add example.html, git commit -m "Add example message", git push
    - create repo from github with ssh
- work with the html:
    ```
    - <h1></h1>, <h3></h3>, <p></p> <em></em>, <ul></ul>, <ol></ol>, <li></li>,<img scr="test.png" alt="test">, <a href="madnessdir/recipe.html">Tonsofchili Recipe</a>, html boilerplate, and the ! shortcut in vscode to create boilerplate
    ```
- structuring the file by creating img folder/directory to store all images

This is somewhat brutal but somehow along the way I had problems with the
git basics. To quit git log just simply press q after to end its line on
terminal. But, so far I'm enjoying this.
